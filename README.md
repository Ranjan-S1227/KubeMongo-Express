## K8's

In this demonstration project, I've leveraged Kubernetes to deploy a MongoDB and Mongo-Express application in a local development environment using Minikube. I orchestrated the setup through carefully crafted deployment YAML files, creating pods for both MongoDB and Mongo-Express. These deployments were accompanied by corresponding Kubernetes services to facilitate interaction with the containerized applications.

To ensure robust configuration management, I utilized a ConfigMap to externalize the MongoDB database configurations. In parallel, security was a paramount concern, addressed through the implementation of a Kubernetes Secret for MongoDB authentication. This secret was meticulously encoded in base64, safeguarding sensitive credentials.

Further exploring Kubernetes' capabilities, I delved into namespaces, effectively isolating different components of the application for enhanced organization and security. A crucial part of my project was configuring Ingress resources. These were instrumental in exposing the Mongo-Express interface and the Kubernetes Dashboard, each residing in their respective namespaces, to external traffic. This setup not only facilitated user access but also provided insightful learnings into Kubernetes' networking intricacies."

### Application Flow:

1. Local Node Setup Using Minikube: You started by setting up a single-node Kubernetes cluster locally using Minikube. This provided a sandbox environment for your Kubernetes applications.

2. Creating Pods with Deployment YAMLs: 
   - **MongoDB Pod**: You created a deployment for MongoDB, which resulted in the creation of a MongoDB pod. This pod hosts the MongoDB database.
   - **Mongo-Express Pod**: Similarly, a deployment for Mongo-Express was created, resulting in a separate pod for the Mongo-Express web-based MongoDB admin interface.

3. Creating Services for Interaction: 
   - For each pod (MongoDB and Mongo-Express), you created Kubernetes services. These services act as an abstraction layer, enabling network access to the pods.

4. ConfigMap for MongoDB Configuration: You used a ConfigMap to externalize and manage the configuration of the MongoDB database. This approach allows for flexible and dynamic configuration changes without the need to rebuild images or restart pods.

5. Securing MongoDB with Secrets: For secure authentication to MongoDB, you implemented a Kubernetes Secret. This secret contains the encoded credentials for MongoDB, providing a secure way to handle sensitive information.

6. Namespace Configuration for Organization: You utilized Kubernetes namespaces to segregate and organize different components of your project, enhancing manageability and security.

7. Implementing Ingress for External Access: 
   - Kubernetes Dashboard Namespace: You configured an Ingress resource in the 'kubernetes-dashboard' namespace, enabling external access to the Kubernetes Dashboard.
   - Mongo-Express Ingress: Another Ingress was configured for the Mongo-Express interface, allowing external web access to this tool.
